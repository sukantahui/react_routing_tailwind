    "question": "What is the fundamental operating principle of Cascading decoders?",
    "shortAnswer": "Deterministic hardware signal processing governed by Boolean logic and semiconductor switching characteristics.",
    "explanation": "Under Cascading decoders, inputs are evaluated through interconnected logic gates or bistable flip-flops to produce stable, hazard-free digital outputs.",
    "hint": "Think about truth tables, propagation delays, and excitation equations.",
    "level": "basic",
    "codeExample": "// Verilog HDL structural description for Cascading decoders\nmodule circuit_block (input wire a, input wire b, output wire y);\n  assign y = a & b;\nendmodule"

    "question": "How do timing constraints (Setup & Hold times) govern the reliable operation of sequential circuits?",
    "shortAnswer": "Data must remain stable before (t_su) and after (t_h) the active clock edge to prevent metastability.",
    "explanation": "Violating setup or hold times traps the internal bistable latch between logic 0 and 1, causing nondeterministic voltage oscillations (metastability).",
    "hint": "Recall that flip-flops require a brief window of stability around the clock trigger.",
    "level": "moderate",
    "codeExample": "// Timing check in Verilog:\n$setup(data_in, posedge clk, 2.5); // 2.5 ns setup time requirement\n$hold(posedge clk, data_in, 1.0);  // 1.0 ns hold time requirement"
