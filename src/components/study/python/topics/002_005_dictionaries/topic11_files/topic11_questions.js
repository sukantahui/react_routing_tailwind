    "question": "What is the fundamental programming concept behind Dictionary comprehension?",
    "shortAnswer": "Applying clean Pythonic syntax and robust data structures for deterministic execution.",
    "explanation": "In Python programming, Dictionary comprehension establishes the foundation for building maintainable, scalable, and bug-free application logic.",
    "hint": "Consider the syntax rules, data types, and standard library mechanisms involved.",
    "level": "basic",
    "codeExample": "# Example demonstration for Dictionary comprehension\ndef process_data():\n    return \"Validated Result\""
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Python memory management and garbage collection handle data under Dictionary comprehension?",
    "shortAnswer": "Through reference counting supplemented by a cyclic generational garbage collector.",
    "explanation": "CPython automatically increments and decrements reference counts as variables point to objects, deallocating memory immediately when the reference count drops to zero.",
    "hint": "Think about variable references, object mutability, and the sys.getrefcount() function.",
    "level": "moderate",
    "codeExample": "import sys\nx = [1, 2, 3]\nprint(sys.getrefcount(x)) # Outputs reference count"
